1. Time taken: 445 secs = 7 mins approx. 
2. Removed inserting i,i and j,j because we are taking into account 1->1->3 by i,j.
3. Removed else part since we are not taking into account i,i 
4. using function I am getting P_ID = 0 in the cocon matrix but without using function it's working perfectly fine.
